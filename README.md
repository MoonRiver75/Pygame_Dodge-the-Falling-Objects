# Dodge the Falling Objects - Pygame Project  

Welcome to **Dodge the Falling Objects**, a simple yet addictive 2D game developed using **Pygame**, a popular Python library for game development. In this game, you control a character who must avoid falling objects to survive as long as possible. How long can you last?  

## Game Description  
The goal of the game is simple: **dodge the falling objects**! As the player, you control a character at the bottom of the screen. Objects (like rocks, fruits, or other items) fall from the top of the screen at increasing speeds. Your mission is to move left and right to avoid being hit. The longer you survive, the higher your score!  

### Key Features:  
- **Dynamic Gameplay**: Objects fall at random positions and speeds, making each round unique.  
- **Increasing Difficulty**: The game gets harder over time, with objects falling faster and more frequently.  
- **Score System**: Track your progress with a live score counter. Can you beat your high score?  
- **Simple Controls**: Use the arrow keys or `A` and `D` to move left and right.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Pygame**: A Python library for creating 2D games.  
- **Python**: The core programming language used for game logic.  
- **Random Module**: To generate random positions and speeds for the falling objects.  

## Why This Project?  
This game was created as a fun way to explore **Pygame** and improve my skills in game development. It demonstrates my ability to:  
- Implement game logic and mechanics.  
- Handle user input and real-time updates.  
- Create a simple yet engaging user experience.
